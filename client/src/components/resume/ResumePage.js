                <p>
                    I am a Senior Software Developer with over 14 years of experience in technology. I started out as a Network Administrator in the Marine Corps.
                    I am an accomplished network and server Engineer; I am also a full stack developer; for the last two years, I have been working with a 
                    fortune 500 company that has entrusted me with their SEO health as well as continued development of their product. I am also experienced in unit testing, 
                    functional testing, and RESTful services. I am constantly expanding my knowledge; I pride myself on my versatility, and not just knowing how to solve a 
                    problem but also understanding why we need to solve it.
